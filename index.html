              You are being asked to participate in a research study titled 
              "Social Judgment and Decision-Making." You were selected to participate in 
              this project because you are an adult over age 18. This study is sponsored by 
              Boston College and the John Templeton Foundation.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              The purpose of this study is to understand how we weigh information about 
              others. This study will be conducted through this online survey. The survey 
              should take you between 15–45 minutes to complete. There are no direct 
              benefits to you, but you may feel gratified knowing that you helped further 
              the scholarly work in this research area, and we will compensate you for your 
              participation at a rate of $9.00/hour. In some cases, we will ask you about 
              your opinions; in other cases, we will ask you to try to answer questions and 
              prompts accurately. When we ask for the latter, we will also provide 
              additional compensation for each correct response. That rate will be $0.05 
              per correct response. There are no costs to you associated with your 
              participation.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              The researchers do not believe participation would entail any risks or 
              discomforts beyond those ordinarily encountered in everyday life.

              This Principal Investigator, Dr. Liane Young, will exert all reasonable efforts 
              to keep your responses and your identity confidential. We will not maintain 
              within our research data any information that uniquely identifies you, such as 
              your name, location, or Internet Protocol (IP) address. In any report we 
              publish, we will not include any information that will make it possible to 
              identify a participant. Data that includes user-ID information will be collected 
              and stored via third-party servers like Qualtrics or Pavlovia. Data collected 
              from the experiment will be coded to remove your name or any other 
              personal identifiers. All records will be secured in a locked cabinet in our lab. 
              The Institutional Review Board at Boston College and internal Boston College 
              auditors may review the research records. State or federal laws or court 
              orders may also require that information from research study records be 
              released. Otherwise, the researchers will not release to others any 
              information that could indicate your identity unless you give your permission, 
              or unless the researchers become legally required to do so.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              Although the survey will not prompt you directly to identify yourself by 
              name, email address or the like, the survey will include several demographic 
              items that would prompt you to provide certain demographic information, 
              such as your age, gender, ethnicity, education level and the like. In 
              combination, responses to such questions could suggest your identity. 
              Regardless, please know that the researchers will make no purposeful effort 
              to discern your identity based on such information. Additionally, please note 
              that you may opt to leave any such questions blank.

              Your participation is voluntary. If you choose not to participate it will not 
              affect your relations with Boston College. Some questions on the survey, 
              such as comprehension questions, may be required in order to complete the 
              survey and receive compensation. However, you may still choose to end 
              your participation in the study at any time. If you have questions or concerns

          Welcome to this experiment! On the following pages, you will see a 
          series of statements describing actions taken by prominent people, 
          such as celebrities and historical figures.
          <strong>All of the people from these statements are real people.</strong>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
          Your task is to assess the percentage of individuals in the United States 
          who believe each statement to be true or false. In order to accomplish this, 
          we will present you with the viewpoints of a sample that represents the entire nation.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
          <strong>
            We are interested in both your perceptions of the beliefs held by the American public

        `<h2><strong>Instructions (2/7)</strong></h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
          We found out what percentage of people in the U.S. believe the statements you will see are true 
          or false in a previous study. For that study, we made sure to recruit a nationally representative 
          sample so that the views of those participants should accurately represent the views of people

          We will ask you several other questions about these statements,
          including how curious you are to learn more about what other people think about them.
          When answering questions about curiosity, sometimes people say that they are curious
          about <em>everything</em> when they actually differ slightly in how curious they are.

          When answering the question of how curious you are, keep in mind that <strong>you shouldn't
